# Decentralized-control-of-EV-charge
Decentralized control of V2G/G2V with updated baseload.
The result is very close to the centralized method.
This method considers the order of EVs and updates the benchmark load in real time.
However, the limitation is that EVs arriving at the same time are considered separately.
